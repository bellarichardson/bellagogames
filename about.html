                <p class="pabout">hi! i’m bella and this is a website that reflects one of my early internet memories, girlsgogames.com! logging onto my mom’s computer to dress up a character or paint a girl’s nails was something I always looked forward to. as i played these games, i would imagine myself as the girls on the screen, which is why you have the chance to dress me up!</p>
                <p class="pabout">this is a digital world filled with games that my younger self would have loved. i hope you enjoy this website as much as i would have!</p>
